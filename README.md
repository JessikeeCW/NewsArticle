## Approach

When building this application, I wanted to choose the best technologies that would fit this app. I chose React because it has reusable components. React also has Hooks, which gives the application a simpler way to maintain local state.I chose Next.js because it utilizes only Javascript, it gives automatic server-side rendering, and it pairs well with React. I chose NoSQL database because the information is non-relational, this gives the ability to improve the speed of my application by querying through objects. Lastly, I designed the interface using Bootstrap to give it a simple and uniform look and it pairs well with React.
